# FFMpeg-for-Android
FFmpeg compiled for armeabi &amp; armeabi-v7a. 

Compilation done using https://github.com/IljaKosynkin/FFmpeg-Development-Kit/tree/master/ffmpeg

Test1.cpp files includes a sample code to read all frames of an input video. 

You can find some more tutorials here http://dranger.com/ffmpeg/

Before compiling don't forget to update the paths in config.h, config.log, config.mak inside Development kit. I have used NDK version r12b for this project.
